A veterinary practice application that allows vets to manage appointments. 

The tech stack is made up of Ruby with Sinatra framework as the server side language and HTML & CSS as the client side language. We are also using the PostgreSQL for our database.

MVP:
  - A table of all pets/animals that have appointments to be seen.
  - Keeps a track of whether the animal has been seen or not 
  - Keep a track of the owners details + pet details
  - A list of all clients and their pets.
  - Add a pet to owner 
  - add pet to appointment
  - CRUD actions for animals/owners/appointments

Potential features:
  - Have a seperate list for emergency bookings
  - List all bookings for a specific day
  - Keep a track of consultation time slots
  - Check whether the day is fully booked


Distant goals:
  A local version of the app that does not rely on a web based server.
  A full practice management system.

Motivation:
  It is difficult to find an appointment system that is both well designed and cost effective. This app looks to bridge the gap between the two.

Installation:
  The app will be contained within a web server and allow access from any location with internet access.
